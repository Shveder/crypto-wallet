Description of the project "Cryptowallet" Introduction The Crypto Wallet project is a modern web application designed to manage cryptocurrency assets and provide secure storage, sending and receiving of cryptocurrencies. This application combines client and server architectures to provide a complete set of tools for working with cryptocurrencies.

Technologies and tools The Cryptowallet project uses modern technologies and tools to achieve its goals:

ASP.NET Core: This web framework enables fast and scalable web application development. It is used to create application server components.

PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL relational database is used to store data about users, their cryptocurrency accounts and transactions. It provides reliable and scalable storage.

HTML and CSS: HTML and CSS are used to create the user interface of the application, providing a pleasant and intuitive user experience with the system.

React: React is a JavaScript library that is used to create dynamic and interactive user interface elements. He is responsible for the client side of the application.

API and REST: The project implements a RESTful API for interaction between the client and server parts of the application. The API provides a standardized way to exchange data.

ILogger: ILogger is a logging mechanism that serves to log events and errors in an application, making it easier to debug and monitor system performance.

Client-Server Architecture The Cryptowallet project implements a client-server architecture, which allows you to effectively manage data and business logic of the application. Here's how it works:

Server side: The backend of the application, based on ASP.NET Core and PostgreSQL, is responsible for processing business logic and storing data. This is where all transaction processing, query validation, and database management takes place.

Client side: The client side is developed using React, HTML and CSS. This part provides the user interface and interaction with the server via an API. Users can view their accounts, perform transactions, and manage cryptocurrency assets.

API: A RESTful API serves as a bridge between the client and server sides. It defines the structure of requests and responses, which provides a standardized way of exchanging data. The API allows clients to send requests to the server to perform various operations.

Client-server architecture ensures scalability, security and ease of project maintenance. Users can interact with the application through a browser or mobile device, which makes the Crypto Wallet project convenient and accessible to anyone interested in cryptocurrencies.
